## 8. Cross-Browser Compatibility

### ✅ Web Standards
- [x] Flutter web compatible code only
- [x] No platform-specific dependencies
- [x] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [x] Touch-friendly UI elements

## 9. Testing Validation

### ✅ Local Testing
To test locally before deployment:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

### ✅ Production Build
To build for production:
```bash
flutter build web --release
```

### ✅ GitHub Deployment
The app will automatically deploy to:
https://go-global-recruitment.github.io/Build-Deploy-Flutter-Web-to-Root/

## 10. Common Issues Prevention

### ✅ Path Issues
- [x] All paths relative to project root
- [x] No absolute paths in code
- [x] Proper asset path declarations

### ✅ Runtime Errors

- [x] All assets properly referenced with correct paths
- [x] .nojekyll file included to prevent GitHub processing

## Expected Result

After following this checklist, the SkyQuest Flight Booking App should:

1. ✅ Build successfully on GitHub Actions
2. ✅ Deploy without errors to GitHub Pages
3. ✅ Load correctly in web browsers
4. ✅ Navigate between all screens without errors
5. ✅ Display all UI elements properly
6. ✅ Function with all features (search, booking, etc.)
7. ✅ Handle user interactions without crashes
8. ✅ Maintain consistent styling and branding

## Troubleshooting

If deployment issues occur:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for build errors
2. **Verify all dependencies** are correctly listed in pubspec.yaml
3. **Ensure base href** matches repository name
4. **Confirm asset paths** are correct in code
5. **Validate JSON parsing** in model files
6. **Check for missing files** in git repository

The application should be fully functional at:
